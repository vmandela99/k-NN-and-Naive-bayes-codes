This document shows notes on decisions trees as I learn them for the first time.

```{r making decisions with trees}
# Load the rpart package
library(rpart)

# Build a lending model predicting loan outcome versus loan amount and credit score
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ loan_amount + credit_score, data = loans, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Make a prediction for someone with good credit
predict(loan_model, good_credit, type = "class")

# Make a prediction for someone with bad credit
predict(loan_model, bad_credit, type = "class")
```
