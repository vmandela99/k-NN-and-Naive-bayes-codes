This document shows notes on decisions trees as I learn them for the first time.

```{r making decisions with trees}
# Load the rpart package
library(rpart)

# Build a lending model predicting loan outcome versus loan amount and credit score
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ loan_amount + credit_score, data = loans, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Make a prediction for someone with good credit
predict(loan_model, good_credit, type = "class")

# Make a prediction for someone with bad credit
predict(loan_model, bad_credit, type = "class")

 # Growing a decision tree is certainly faster than growing a real tree! hahha

# Examine the loan_model object
loan_model

# Load the rpart.plot package
library(rpart.plot)

# Plot the loan_model with default settings
rpart.plot(loan_model)

# Plot the loan_model with customized settings
rpart.plot(loan_model, type = 3, box.palette = c("red", "green"), fallen.leaves = TRUE)

# The following image shows the structure of a classification tree predicting loan outcome from the applicant's credit score and requested loan amount.


# Determine the number of rows for training
nrow(loans) * 0.75

# Create a random sample of row IDs
sample_rows <- sample(nrow(loans), nrow(loans) * 0.75)

# Create the training dataset
loans_train <- loans[sample_rows, ]

# Create the test dataset
loans_test <- loans[-sample_rows, ]
```
